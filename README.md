# Module 01 Horiseon Refactor Project

## Description

A Refactoring project issued by Horiseon in order to improve both the accessibility to viewers, as well as the semantics for any future adjustments needed to be done to
the code itself; I was able to use my knowledge of more accessible semantic identifiers and consolidation of CSS elements in order to create a framework and stylesheet
that is significantly easier to navigate and understand than it was previously.

In this repo:

Added comments to both the HTML and CSS for ease of future development
Converted HTML elements into more semantic ones
Edited the HTML elements to follow a better structure
Gave the images accessible alt descriptors
Adjusted the headers to be in sequential order
Gave the website a more descriptive title
Fixed one of the broken nav links at the top of the page
Consolidated CSS selectors to reduce file size
Organized the CSS selectors to follow a more logical flow



## Installation

No Installation required, either follow the link and use the chrome DevTools to inspect the refactoring, or download the repo and view them in on your local PC.

## Usage

Use the code provided in both the html and the css to gain a better understanding on how to write more accessible html files and to reduce css selector redundancies
